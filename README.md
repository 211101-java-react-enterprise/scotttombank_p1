# **Overview:**
The Scott-Tom Banking Application is a custom banking app that allows users to register and login to their checkings account. Users can also deposit and withdraw (overdraft protected) money from their account. The application also has a custom Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows for a simple and SQL-free interaction with a relational data source and abstracts away low-level JDBC. The ORM utilizes the JAVA Relection API to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for entity object persistence. The application also implements a servlet-based web app to demsontrate the functionaliies of the ORM.
